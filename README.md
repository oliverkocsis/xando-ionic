# X and O

Xs and Os (Irish English), tic-tac-toe (American English) or noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. [^1]

The game is implemented using React and Ionic Framework.
